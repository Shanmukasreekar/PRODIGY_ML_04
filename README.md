Hand Gesture Recognition Model using CNN
Project Description
This project involves developing a Hand Gesture Recognition Model that identifies and classifies various hand gestures from image or video data. The aim is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction for gesture-based control systems.

Features
Gesture Classification: Recognizes predefined hand gestures.
Data Type: Image and video-based input.
Workflow:
Data preprocessing
Gesture feature extraction
Model training and evaluation
Steps to Run the Project
Dataset Setup:

Prepare a dataset of labeled hand gesture images or videos.
Organize the data into training and testing directories.
Install Dependencies:
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

numpy
opencv-python
tensorflow/keras
matplotlib
Run the command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib  
Preprocessing:

Resize images to a fixed size (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
Normalize pixel values for better performance.
Extract features using convolutional layers or custom methods.
Train the Model:

Use the preprocessed dataset to train the gesture recognition model.
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.
Run the Script:

Execute the Python script to classify hand gestures in real-time or from static images.
Files Included
gesture_recognition.py: Main script for training and testing the model.
README.TXT: Documentation for the project.
Future Enhancements
Expand to recognize dynamic gestures in real-time video streams.
Enhance the model for multilingual gesture support or AR/VR integration.
Credits
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
Dataset: Custom hand gesture dataset or publicly available resources.
